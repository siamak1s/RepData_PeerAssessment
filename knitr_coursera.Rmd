## Assignement
#Loading and preprocessing the data
1. Loading the data
```{r}
path <- "~/Downloads/activity.csv"
data <- read.csv(path)
library(ggplot2)
summary(data)
```
2. Process/transform the data (if necessary) into a format suitable for your analysis
```{r}
data_tidy <- data[!is.na(data$steps),]
head(data_tidy)
```
#What is mean of total number of steps taken per day?
For this part of the assignement the missing values are ignored.
1. Total number of steps taken per day
```{r}
total_steps <- aggregate(data_tidy$steps, by = list(date = data_tidy$date), FUN = sum)
head(total_steps)
```

Renaming the second column as number of steps:
```{r}
names(total_steps)[2] <- "steps"
```

2. Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
```{r}
hist(total_steps$steps,     main="Histogram for total number of steps taken each day",     xlab="Steps",     border="blue",     col="green",     las=1)
```

3. Mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day
Mean of the total number of steps taken per day
```{r}
mean(total_steps$steps)
```

Median of the total number of steps taken per day
```{r}
median(total_steps$steps)
```

# What is the average daily activity pettern?
1. Plot of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
```{r}
mean_steps <- aggregate(data_tidy$steps, by = list(interval = data_tidy$interval), FUN = mean)
names(mean_steps)[2] <- "steps"
with(mean_steps,plot(interval,steps,type = "l"))
```

2. The interval contains the maximum number of steps, on average across all the days in the dataset.
```{r}
mean_steps[max(mean_steps$steps),]
```

# Imputing missing values
As it is obvious in "data", there are a number of days/intervals where there are missing values (coded as 𝙽𝙰). The presence of missing days may introduce bias into some calculations or summaries of the data.
```{r}
summary(data)
```

1. Total number of missing values in dataset
```{r}
sum(is.na(data$steps))
```

2. Strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset is to use the mean for that 5-minute interval.
3. Dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.
```{r}
data2 <- data
if ((data2[is.na(data2$steps),])$interval == mean_steps$interval) {data2[is.na(data2$steps),]$steps = mean_steps$steps}
head(data2)
```

4. Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day. 
```{r}
total_steps2 <- aggregate(data2$steps, by = list(date = data2$date), FUN = sum)
names(total_steps2)[2] <- "steps"
hist(total_steps2$steps,     main="Histogram for total number of steps taken each day",     xlab="Steps",     border="blue",     col="green",     las=1)
```

4. The mean and median total number of steps taken per day.
```{r}
mean(total_steps2$steps)
median(total_steps2$steps)
```

As we can see there is no difference between the one without missing values.

# Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

1. Createing a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
```{r}
data22 <- data2
data22$date <- as.Date(data22$date)
data22$date <- weekdays(data22$date)
data22$week.day <- ifelse(data22$date == "Saturday" | data22$date == "Sunday","weekend","weekday")
data22$week.day <- as.factor(data22$week.day)
head(data22)
```

2. Plot containing a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis)
```{r}
a22 <- aggregate(data22$steps, by = list(interval = data22$interval, week.day = data22$week.day), FUN = mean)
g <- ggplot(a22,aes(x=interval,y=x))
g + geom_line() + facet_grid(week.day~.) + labs(y = "steps")
```
